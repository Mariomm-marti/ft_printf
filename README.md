# ft_printf - 42 third programming project
This project was a huge rework of my way of thinking about coding. I have done
several versions of this project but none of them completely functional, as I didn't like the way of doing it.

The name pretty much sumarizes what this project is about: recreate the original
printf. This helped me improve some stuff such as the code organization, code readability, Git knowledge, and a really long etc.


## Usage
1. Clone project `git clone https://github.com/Mariomm-marti/ft_printf.git`
2. You will need to clone libft, either inside `ft_printf/srcs` or outside
3. To compile and use `ft_printf`, do `make FTPTF_LIBFT=<libft_path>`

You can also choose the path for your library output by doing: `make FTPTF_OUT=output_path FTPTF_LIBFT=libft_path`, or just leave them blank and use default paths

## Score
This project, although not entirely finished, was already submitted and scored 102/115
