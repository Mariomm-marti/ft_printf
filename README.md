# ft_printf - 42 third programming project
This project was a huge rework of my way of thinking about coding. I have done
several versions of this project but none of them completely functional, as I didn't like the way of doing it.

The name pretty much sumarizes what this project is about: recreate the original
printf. This helped me improve some stuff such as the code organization, code readability, Git knowledge, and a really long etc.

This project does include `libft` (https://github.com/Mariomm-marti/libft.git) as a submodule


## Usage
1. Clone project `git clone https://github.com/Mariomm-marti/ft_printf.git`
2. At the folder, run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`
3. To compile and use `ft_printf`, include printf as a dependency in your project
and compile using compiler flags `-L{libftprintf.a path} -lftprintf`

One line for the first two steps:
```
git clone https://github.com/Mariomm-marti/ft_printf.git && \
cd ft_printf && \
git submodule init && \
git submodule update && \
make
```
